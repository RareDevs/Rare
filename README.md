# Rare

## A frontend for legendary, the open source Epic Games Launcher alternative

Rare is currently considered beta software and in no way feature-complete. You will probably run into issues, so it is recommend to make a backup. If you have features you want to have in this app, create an issue on github, contact me on Discord (Dummerle#7419) or build it yourself. Please report bugs so I can fix them.
